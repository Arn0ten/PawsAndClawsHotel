Welcome to **Big Paws Petsupplies**! Our pet hotel offers premium boarding, daycare, and pet care services for all your furry friends. This system aims to streamline communication, organize pet care information, and provide a better experience for both our staff and pet owners.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Big Paws Petsupplies is transforming how we communicate and manage pets at our hotel. From automated update requests to a professional customer portal, we are building a system that will help us stay organized, efficient, and keep our pet owners happy.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Centralized Update Requests**: Pet owners can request updates (photos/videos) and receive timely responses directly from the system.
- **Organized Pet Profiles**: All pet details (feeding schedules, health notes, special instructions) are securely stored for easy access.
- **Request Tracking**: Track and prioritize update requests to ensure no request is overlooked.
- **Customer Portal**: A portal where pet owners can manage their pets' stay, view updates, and communicate with the staff.

## 📈 Project Objectives

- **100% of update requests** will be logged in the system within 2 months.
- **95% of pet profiles** will be digitized and stored within 1 month.
- **90% reduction in manual tracking** of requests within 3 months.
- **90% adoption rate** of the customer portal within 4 months.
- **95% of update requests** will be responded to within 24 hours.
